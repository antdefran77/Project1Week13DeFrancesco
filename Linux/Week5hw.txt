### Step 1: Create, Extract, Compress, and Manage tar Backup Archives

1. Command to **extract** the `TarDocs.tar` archive to the current directory: tar -xvf TarDocs.tar

2. Command to **create** the `Javaless_Doc.tar` archive from the `TarDocs/` directory, while excluding the `TarDocs/Documents/Java` directory: tar -tvf Javaless_Docs.tar

3. Command to ensure `Java/` is not in the new `Javaless_Docs.tar` archive: grep "Java"

**Bonus** 
- Command to create an incremental archive called `logs_backup_tar.gz` with only changed files to `snapshot.file` for the `/var/log` directory:

#### Critical Analysis Question

- Why wouldn't you use the options `-x` and `-c` at the same with `tar`? Because it would try to read the last arguement in the string as a FILE and a MEMBER and it cant be both so maybe you would recieve an error

### Step 2: Create, Manage, and Automate Cron Jobs

1. Cron job for backing up the `/var/log/auth.log` file: crontab -e 

* 6 * * 3 sysadmin tar -acvvf authback.tgz /var/log/auth.log

---

### Step 3: Write Basic Bash Scripts

1. Brace expansion command to create the four subdirectories: mkdir -p ~/backups/{freemem,diskuse,openlist,freedisk}/

2. Paste your `system.sh` script edits below: 

    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
   
echo "Memory Info:" > ~/backups/freemem/free_mem.txt
free >> ~/backups/freemem/free_mem.txt

echo -e "\nDisk Usage:" > ~/backups/diskuse/disk_usage.txt
df -H | head -2 >> ~/backups/diskuse/disk_usage.txt

lsof > ~/backups/openlist/open_list.txt
df -h > ~/backups/freedisk/free_disk.txt
    ```

3. Command to make the `system.sh` script executable: chmod +x system.sh

**Optional**
- Commands to test the script and confirm its execution: ls and see if its green if your system is setup that way or

if [[ -x "$system.sh ]]
then
    echo "File '$system.sh' is executable"
else
    echo "File '$system.sh' is not executable"
fi
**Bonus**
- Command to copy `system` to system-wide cron directory:

### Step 4. Manage Log File Sizes
 
1. Run `sudo nano /etc/logrotate.conf` to edit the `logrotate` configuration file. 

    Configure a log rotation scheme that backs up authentication messages to the `/var/log/auth.log`.

    - Add your config file edits below:

    ```bash  
#
#
weekly

#
#
su root syslog

#
#
rotate 7

notifempty
#
create

#
delaycompress

#
include /var/log/auth.log

#
/var/log/wtmp {
missingok
monthly
create 0664 root utmp
rotate 1
}

/var/log/btmp {
missingok
monthly
create 0660 root utmp
rotate 1
}
 
    ```

### Bonus: Check for Policy and File Violations

1. Command to verify `auditd` is active:

2. Command to set number of retained logs and maximum log file size:

    - Add the edits made to the configuration file below:

    ```bash
    [Your solution edits here]
    ```

3. Command using `auditd` to set rules for `/etc/shadow`, `/etc/passwd` and `/var/log/auth.log`:


    - Add the edits made to the `rules` file below:

    ```bash
    [Your solution edits here]
    ```

4. Command to restart `auditd`:

5. Command to list all `auditd` rules:

6. Command to produce an audit report:

7. Create a user with `sudo useradd attacker` and produce an audit report that lists account modifications:

8. Command to use `auditd` to watch `/var/log/cron`:

9. Command to verify `auditd` rules:

---

### Bonus (Research Activity): Perform Various Log Filtering Techniques

1. Command to return `journalctl` messages with priorities from emergency to error:

1. Command to check the disk usage of the system journal unit since the most recent boot:

1. Comand to remove all archived journal files except the most recent two:


1. Command to filter all log messages with priority levels between zero and two, and save output to `/home/sysadmin/Priority_High.txt`:

1. Command to automate the last command in a daily cronjob. Add the edits made to the crontab file below:

    ```bash
    [Your solution cron edits here]
    ```
